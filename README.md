## Installation 

First star it. 
Then you could either fork it or download a zip file of it.
You should also have Node installed to your machine and the Inquirer npm.

## Usage

Once you have the above all done, you can open up the folder in your code editor of choice, mine is VS Code, and then summon node in your terminal followed immediately by index, like such :

``` node index```

Then follow the question prompt.

And there you go, a markdown file, created just for you!
